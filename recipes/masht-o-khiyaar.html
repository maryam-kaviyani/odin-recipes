    <h1 id="h1">Masht-o Khiyaar (Persian Cucumber Salad with Sultanas and Walnuts)</h1>
    <img src="../images/2.webp" alt="Masht-o Khiyaar (Persian Cucumber Salad with Sultanas and Walnuts)">
    <p>This is a Persian recipe and my favorite cucumber salad.
         Cucumbers are combined with toasted walnuts and sultanas
          and a light dressing of yogurt, fresh dill, and fresh mint.
           For best results refrigerate salad for about 1 hour.</p>

           <h2>Ingredients</h2>
           <ul>
            <li>1 Â½ cups plain yogurt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons roughly chopped walnuts</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons golden raisins (sultanas), roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 large cucumber - peeled, seeded, and diced</li>
           </ul>
           
          <h2>Directions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
                Place yogurt into a fine-mesh sieve lined with a
                 coffee filter and allow to drain, about 20 minutes.
                  You should end up with about a cup of thick yogurt.  
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a small skillet over medium heat, add walnuts,
                 and toast while stirring until nuts start to turn
                  golden brown and become fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Allow to cool.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix yogurt, sultanas, walnuts, dill, mint,
                 salt, and pepper in a large bowl, add cucumber and toss to combine.
                  Refrigerate for 1 hour.
            </li>
          </ol>
