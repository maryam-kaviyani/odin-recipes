    <p>Disclaimer: I am not Persian. This recipe my mother learned from Fatima 
        in Tehran when we lived there in 1973. I grew up eating this dish and
         learned it at my mother's elbow. It was also a company dish and many
          people claiming to hate eggplant enjoyed this dish.</p>

          <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>2 cups basmati rice</li>
            <li>1 pound eggplant, sliced into 1-inch rounds</li>
            <li>1 pound beef stew meat</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>

            <li>¼ cup butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Directions</h2>

          <ol>
            <li>
                Rinse rice in a sieve until water runs clear.
                 Pour into a bowl, cover with water.
                  Leave to soak for 1 hour or overnight.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Toss eggplant with salt in a separate bowl; 
                    let set for 1 hour. Rinse salt from eggplant in a colander;
                     cut into 1-inch cubes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Toss stew meat with cinnamon and turmeric in a separate bowl.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
                         Add stew meat and cook until browned on all sides,
                          about 5 minutes. Remove from pan; set aside.
                           Add eggplant, onion, and diced tomatoes to the skillet;
                            cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 7 minutes.
                             Return stew meat to the pan; add tomato sauce.
                              Cover skillet and lower heat to medium-low;
                               cook until meat is tender and sauce has thickened, 
                               about 40 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While the beef is cooking, prepare the rice.
                         Bring 4 cups water to a rapid boil in a saucepan;
                          drain rice. Add rice and 1 teaspoon salt to saucepan;
                           boil until partially cooked, about 11 minutes.
                            Drain rice in sieve; return saucepan to medium heat.
                             Melt 2 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon water together in the saucepan. 
                             Spoon rice back into saucepan a spoonful at a time. 
                             Dot remaining butter on top of the rice,
                              cover tightly and lower heat to medium-low; cook for 30 minutes. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Remove both the rice and the eggplant mixture from heat
                         and let stand for 10 minutes. Before serving,
                          carefully place a serving dish on top of the saucepan
                           and invert rice onto serving dish. Transfer stew into
                            a serving bowl and serve with rice.
